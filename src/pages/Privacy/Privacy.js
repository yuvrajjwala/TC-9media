                                    Starting January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including a) the right to see what data we have about
                                    you, your computer, or device (i.e., the right to know), b) the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of
                                    data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of your information). We do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.
                                    Moreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.

                                    personal information that we have about you. We will confirm your request within 10 days and make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days. In 2020, 9Media Online Inc. did not directly
                                    receive any requests to know, delete, or opt-out from California consumers.

                                    information we have collected about you; (3) categories of sources from which the personal information is collected; (4) categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose
                                    about you; (5) categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose under the CCPA; and (6) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or

                                    for us for billing, fraud prevention, or security purposes. We will share our reason(s) for denying your request in the event that we are unable to fulfill your request.

                                    You may make an access or deletion request via an authorized agent by having such an agent follow the process below. Please note that we will request any authorized agent demonstrate that they have been
                                    authorized by you to make a request on your behalf. And we will attempt to verify your request. We require any authorized agents to provide us with contact details such as an email address and phone

                                    The General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) affords additional data protection rights to EU data subjects. For example, with respect to EU data subjects, the definition of personal data includes
                                    pseudonymous data such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID, or a cookie ID. EU Data subjects have the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and the right to access, port, correct, and
                                    delete certain personal data processed by 9Media Online Inc. (e.g., via the Website) and those Partners that serve ads on our behalf to EU data subjects via the Agency. You may access those rights with
                                    respect to 9Media Online Inc. by scrolling up and reading the section entitled “Data Subject Access Rights” or by sending us an email at <u>privacy@9mediaonline.com</u>.

                                    While 9Media Online Inc. does not physically store personal data in the context of the Agency, we do have Clients located in the EU and we do place media buys on behalf of Clients who may collect data
                                    from data subjects located in the EU. Our Clients and Publishers direct us to process data under their general instructions, but we may direct our technology Partners to adjust advertising campaigns where
                                    we feel appropriate. We rely on the consent of the individual to process personal data in some instances (for example, when the user inputs personal data onto a web form of our Website). On other
                                    occasions, 9Media Online Inc. may process personal data when needed to fulfill a contract with a client or partner or where required to do so by law.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>
                                    We may also process data when it is in our or our Clients’ legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights (which may vary based on
                                    an individual’s jurisdiction). Certain Publishers, Clients, and Partners choose not to operate in the EU and/or collect data from EU data subjects – and each has a process to ensure they are not
                                    collecting personal data from the EU in relation to the Agency.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>
                                    To the extent that our processing activities require the transfer of personal data from EU data subjects to a jurisdiction that does not have an adequate designation from the EU, we will find a suitable
                                    data transfer mechanism such as the Standard Contractual Clauses. If you have questions about this or want to understand your rights in more detail, please feel free to contact us at
